# Gold Rush tests

A repository of tests for the Gold Rush application.

Remember: your code MUST pass all of these tests (if you want to successfully complete the classes ;)

## Table of contents

Tests are organized into different branches corresponding to the iteration and week of that iteration. For example, _i01w01_ refers to the first week of the first iteration, and so on.

- [i01w01](https://gitlab.com/edu.io/gold_rush_tests/-/tree/i01w01?ref_type=heads) -- basic functionality of the `Board` and `Token` classes
